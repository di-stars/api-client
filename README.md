ApiClient handle all the logic necessary to call Some API, catch the response and initialize an object with it for you.
It is possible to use Typhoeus or the native Ruby Library Net::Http.
It works very well with rails, so you can exchange your ActiveRecord based models without any concern and your application will make Api calls transparently.
It supports ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, jruby and ree out of the box.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'api-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install api-client

## Basic Usage

Add this to your ApplicationController:

```ruby
rescue_from ApiClient::Exceptions::NotFound, :with => :not_found

def not_found
    #Specify your own behavior here
end
```

You can define a more generic rescue that will work for any error:

```ruby
rescue_from ApiClient::Exceptions::Generic, :with => :generic_error
```

On Your model, extend ApiClient::Base

```ruby
class User < ApiClient::Base
```

Then, on your action, just put into it:

```ruby
@user = User.get(3)
```

where 3 is the id of the user.

To a request that returns a collection of the object, use:

```ruby
@user = User.collection
```

## Advanced Usage

ApiClient can read api responses with root nodes based on the name of the virtual class.
In Some cases, that is not the required behavior. To Redefine it, use remote_object method:

```ruby
class Admin < ApiClient::Base
    self.remote_object = "user"
end
```

It can handle associations. It will automatically instantiate an association for you if properly setted like below:

```ruby
class Person < ApiClient::Base
    self.associations = { :houses => "House", :cars => "Car" }
end
```

This code will create a setter and a getter for houses and cars and initialize the respective class.

## TODO
   * Add support for parallel requests
   * Add more Response Handlers
